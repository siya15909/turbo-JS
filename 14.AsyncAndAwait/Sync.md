# Synchronous

##

        Code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.
        Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

# Asynchronous

##

        Due to synchronous programming,sometimes important instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions which cause delay in the UI.
        Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.

# Callback

##

        A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function

# Callback Hell

##

        Nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure(Pyramid of Doom)
        This style of programming becomes difficult to understand and manage
